Motion socialnetworking app

Me and a two classmates of mine created this app while doing the Full-Stack course at Propulsion Academy Zurich.
We developed both the Frontend and the Backend from scratch ourselves.

Tools we used:
1. React
2. Redux
3. Styled-components
4. Django
5. Django Rest Framework
6. Swagger
